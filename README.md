I have outlined a guide on how to use this repository below.

I have done this problem sheet to the best of my ability, I had issues with using 2 lists in the merge & sort, the factorial and the newtons square root theory.
I haven't included the .gitignore file as  was usure of how to create a file starting with a dot and I was told that doing it and cloning the repository several times as I had done can be an issue with that.
I wasn't willing to create another repository as I already filled the form to hand up this repository at the below link:
